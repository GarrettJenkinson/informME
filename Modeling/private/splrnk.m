% function [isplit,splval] = splrnk(n,n0,p,x,y)
% determines the splitting index and splitting value for splitting a
% box by rank
% Input:
% n        dimension of the problem
% n0(1:n)  coordinate i has been split n0(i) times in the history of the
%          box to split
% p(1:n)   ranking of estimated variability of the function in the 
%          different coordinates
% x(1:n)   base vertex of the box
% y(1:n)   opposite vertex of the box
% Output:
% isplit   splitting index
% splval   = Inf  if n0(isplit) = 0 (indicates that the box has to be
%                 split according to the initialization list)
%          = splitting value  otherwise
% Uses the following function/m-file:
% split2.m

function [isplit,splval] = splrnk(n,n0,p,x,y)
isplit = 1;
n1 = n0(1);
p1 = p(1);
for i = 2:n
 if n0(i) < n1 | (n0(i) == n1 & p(i) < p1)
  isplit = i;
  n1 = n0(i);
  p1 = p(i);
 end
end 
if n1 > 0
 splval = split2(x(isplit),y(isplit));
else
 splval =  Inf;
end
