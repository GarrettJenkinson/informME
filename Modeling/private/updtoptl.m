% function updtoptl(i,x,y,iopt,level,f)
% a daughter box of a box containing (a) local minimizer(s) is checked
% whether it contains any minimizers, and in case it contains any, the
% corresponding levels and function values are updated 
% Input:
% i      splitting index of the parent box
% x,y    bounds of the ith coordinate of the daughter box 
% iopt   vector containing the indices of the global minimizers the
%        parent box contained
% level  level of the daughter box
% f      base function value of the daughter box

function updtoptl(i,x,y,iopt,level,f)

% foptbox(1:nglob)   base vertex function value(s) of the box(es) 
%        containing the (a) global minimizer of a test function
% optlevel(1:nglob)  their level(s)
% xglob(1:n,1:nglob) xglob(:,i), i=1:nglob, are the global minimizers
