%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% test driver for running MCS 
% with advice on how to choose the tuning parameters
%
% applied to the Jones test functions with default boxes
%
% To solve your own problem, copy this file (to ownmcs.m, say)
% and adapt the first part labelled `problem definition'.
% Then run the driver by typing `ownmcs' at the Matlab prompt.
%
% If you are not satisfied with the results, or if you want to play 
% with the tuning parameters, you also need to adapt the second part
% labelled `change MCS settings'. In particular, for wide bounds,
% you'll probably get better results if you supply your own 
% initialization list.
% 
% On typing `runmcs' at the Matlab prompt,
% the unmodified file produces test results for the six-hump camel
% function; by only changing the data assignment you can also get
% results for the other test functions from Jones et al.
% You may also play with the bounds by modifying the default bounds.

		% prt = 0: no output
		% prt = 1: # sweep, minimal nonempty level, # f-calls,
		%          best point and function value
		% prt > 1: in addition levels and function values of
		%          boxes containing the known global minimizers
		%          of a test function

% define global strategy 
%
% smax governs the relative amount of global versus local search. By
% increasing smax, more weight is given to global search.
% 
% Increasing or decreasing stop(1) increases or decreases the amount 
% of work allowed before concluding that nothing more is gained; 
% the default choice is quite conservative, and may try to locate
% a better point long after the global minimum has been found.
% stop(1)=5 works for many easier problems, too, with much fewer
% wasted function values.
% 
% Increasing nf allows to spend more time on boxes that have a chance 
% on their level to contain better points. This may be important for
% hard problems, or for problems with very wide bounds.
% 
% But in each case, it is unclear in advance what change would be most 
% beneficial to a particular problem. 
% We had very mixed experience; if you have many similar problems to 
% solve, the best thing to do is to experiment with a few problems to 
% find the best values, and to use these on the others. 
%
n = length(u);		% problem dimension
smax = 5*n+10;		% number of levels used
nf = 50*n^2; 		% limit on number of f-calls
stop(1) = 3*n;		% = m, integer defining stopping test
stop(2) = -inf;		% = freach, function value to reach
			% if m>0, run until m sweeps without progress
			% if m=0, run until fbest<=freach
			% (or about nf function calls were used)

if 0, 	% known global optimum, for tests only
	% then the entries of stop have a different meaning
  stop(1) = 1.e-4;	% run until this relative error is achieved
  stop(2) = fglob;	% known global optimum value
  stop(3) = 1.e-10;	% stopping tolerance for tiny fglob
end;

% define initialization strategy
%
% for wide boxes, it is advisable (and for unbounded search regions
% strongly advisable) to define a customized initialization list
% that contains for each coordinate at least three reasonable values.
% Without such an initialization list, mcs makes default assumptions
% that roughly amount to estimating reasonable magnitudes from the 
% bounds and in case iinit=1 from assuming order unity if this is 
% within the bounds. 
%
% for a self-defined initialization list, the user should
% write an m-script file init0.m containing a matrix x0 with n
% rows and at least 3 columns and two n-vectors l and L 
% the ith column of x0 contains the initialization list
% values for the ith coordinate, their number is L(i), and
% x0(i,l(i)) is the ith coordinate of the initial point

iinit = 0;	% 0: simple initialization list
		%    (default for finite bounds;
		%     do not use this for very wide bounds)
		% 1: safeguarded initialization list
		%    (default for unbounded search regions)
		% 2: (5*u+v)/6, (u+v)/2, (u+5*v)/6
		% 3: initialization list with line searches
		% else: self-defined initialization list 
		%       stored in file init0.m

% parameters for local search
%
% A tiny gamma (default) gives a quite accurate but in higher 
% dimensions slow local search. Increasing gamma leads to less work 
% per local search but a less accurately localized minimizer
% 
% If it is known that the Hessian is sparse, providing the sparsity 
% pattern saves many function evaluations since the corresponding
% entries in the Hessian need not be estimated. The default pattern
% is a full matrix.
% 
local = 50;		% local = 0: no local search
			% else: maximal number of steps in local search
gamma = eps;		% acceptable relative accuracy for local search
hess = ones(n,n);	% sparsity pattern of Hessian
