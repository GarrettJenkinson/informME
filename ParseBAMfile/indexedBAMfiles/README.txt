This subdirectory contains indexed BAM files (.bam and .bai)
with reads aligned to a reference genome that are to be
processed in order to produce methylation information about
the status of CpG sites in the genome. These files are
organized within a subdirectory for each species (Human,
Mouse, etc.).
