% local and global line search for noiseless functions
% 
% function [alist,flist,nf]=gls(prt) 	
% debug mode: repeats last line search with new print level 
%
% func:		name for function f=f(data,x)
% data: 	data vector for function call
% xl,xu:	box [xl,xu] for x
% x: 		starting point
% p:		search direction
% alist,flist:	list of known steps and corresponding function values 
%		(at output in order of increasing alp)
% nloc:		saturate nloc best local optima (default 1)
% small:	saturation tolerance (default 0.1)
% smax:		approximate limit of list size (default 10)
% prt:		print level (default 0: nothing plotted or printed)
% 		1: plot progress along the line, and
% 		2: print some things
% 		3: print more things
% nf:		number of function evaluations used
%
% Note: This is a very slow implementation since lots of sort and
%	reshape are used for simplicity of programming
%	but the number of function values used is low
%
% Note: subroutines without arguments 
%	return with a sorted alist and an updated s=size(alist,2);
