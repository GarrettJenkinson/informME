----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains tools for post processing results 
generated by the core modules of informME. This directory 
contains the following files:

bed2bw.sh
---------

This is a BASH scipt that converts BED files to BigWig files.

  usage: 

   ./bed2bw.sh "/path/to/directory/containing/BED/files/" "asy" 
   
   for the assembly "asy" of the reference genome used to 
   generate the BED files (for example, "asy" must be set 
   to "hg19" when the Human assembly hg19 is used). 
  
  output:

   The resulting BigWig files are placed within 
   /path/to/directory/containing/BED/files/BWfiles.

  requirements: 

   The following tools must be installed on $PATH: 
   bedtools, bedClip, bedGraphToBigWig, and 
   fetchChromSizes.
