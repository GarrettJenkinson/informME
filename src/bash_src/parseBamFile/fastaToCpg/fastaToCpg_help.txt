Description:
    This function is used to analyze a reference genome in order to find and store the 
    locations of all CpG sites within each chromosome and to compute the CpG densities at 
    each CpG site as well as the distances between neighboring CpG sites. A 1-based 
    coordinate system is used, in which the first base is assigned to position 1 and the 
    location of a CpG site is defined by the position of the C nucleotide on the forward 
    strand of the reference genome. Each MAT file contains the following information:
      o location of CpG sites
      o CpG density for each CpG site
      o distance between neighboring CpG sites
      o location of the last CpG site in the chormosome
      o length of chromosome (in base pairs)

Usage:
    fastaToCpg.sh  [options]  -- FASTA_FILE
