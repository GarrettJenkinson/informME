Description:
    This function is used to analyze a reference genome in order to find and store the 
    locations of all CpG sites within each chromosome and compute the CpG densities at 
    each CpG site as well as the distances between neighboring CpG sites. A 1-based 
    coordinate system is used, in which the first base is assigned to position 1 and the 
    location of a CpG site is defined by the position of the C nucleotide on the forward 
    strand of the reference genome. Each MAT file produced will be stored by default in 
    REFGENEDIR, and it will contain the following information:
    o location of CpG sites
    o CpG density for each CpG site
    o distance between neighboring CpG sites
    o location of the last CpG site in the chromosome
    o length of chromosome (in base pairs)

Usage:
    fastaToCpg.sh  [OPTIONS]  -- FASTA_FILE

Mandatory argument:
    o FASTA_FILE: reference genome in FASTA format

Options:
    -h|--help           help
    -d|--outdir         output directory (default: $REFGENEDIR)
    -l|--MATLICENSE     path to MATLAB's License

Example:
    fastaToCpg.sh -d /path/to/out -- /path/to/input.fa

Output:
    MATLAB .mat file for each entry in FASTA file

Dependancies:
    MATLAB

Upstream:
    NA

Downstream:
