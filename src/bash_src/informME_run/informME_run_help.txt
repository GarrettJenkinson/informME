Description:
    This function learns the parameters of the Ising model and performs methylation analysis. 
    First, it estimates the parameters of the Ising probability distribution used to model 
    methylation within equally sized (in base pairs) non-overlapping regions of the genome. 
    The input is expected to be in INTERDIR, and the output is also stored in INTERDIR by 
    default. The output file produced in this learning phase contains the following 
    information for each genomic region used in model estimation:
    o CpG distances
    o CpG densities
    o estimated alpha, beta, and gamma parameters of the Ising model
    o initial and transition probabilities of the inhomogeneous Markov chain representation of 
      the Ising model
    o marginal probabilities at each CpG site
    o the log partition function of the estimated Ising model.
    The output file produced by the analysis phase contains the following information:
    o The locations of the CpG sites within the genomic region
    o Numbers of CpG sites within the analysis subregions
    o Which analysis subregions are modeled and which are not
    o Estimated parameters of Ising model in genomic region
    o Methylation level probabilities in modeled subregions
    o Coarse methylation level probabilities
    o Mean methylation levels
    o Normalized methylation entropies
    o Entropic sensitivity indices (if ESIflag = 1)
    o Turnover ratios (if MCflag = 1)
    o Channel capacities (if MCflag = 1)
    o Relative dissipated energies (if MCflag = 1)

Mandatory arguments:
    o MAT_FILES: list of methylation matrices to be modeled.
